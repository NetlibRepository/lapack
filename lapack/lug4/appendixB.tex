\chapter{Indices of Auxiliary Routines}\label{chapindexauxil}\index{index!auxiliary routines}

Notes:

\begin{enumerate}

\item These four indices list routines which are {\bf not} expected to be called by users.
They are listed here primarily to help investigate errors in the users' programs or in the LAPACK routines.

\item The first index lists the unblocked versions of routines, for which the blocked versions
are intended to be called by the users' programs or by higher-level LAPACK routines. The blocked
versions are listed in Appendix~\ref{chapindexuser}.

\item The second index lists the bulk of the auxiliary routines, most, but not all, having names
 beginning xLA-.

\item The third index lists a few routines whose names are not type or precision-dependent.

\item The fourth index lists routines which ideally should have been included in the BLAS,
but the need for them was not realized until after the BLAS were standardized.

\item These indices 
list related pairs of real and complex routines together,
in the same style as in Appendix~\ref{chapindexuser}.

\item Routines are listed in alphanumeric order
of the real (single precision) routine name (which always begins with S-).
(See subsection~\ref{subsecnaming} for details of the LAPACK naming scheme.)

\item Double precision versions of routines have names beginning
D- instead of S-, and Z- instead of C-.

\item This index gives only a brief description of the purpose of each
routine. For a precise description consult the leading comments in the code,
which have been written in the same style as for the driver and
computational routines.
